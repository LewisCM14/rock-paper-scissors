# Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock!

Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock! Is an interactive game hosted in the web browser, making use of several technologies to create a positive experience for the user.  

Its primary goal is to provide enjoyment whilst also highlighting, a perhaps little known, modern adaptation of a classic game. It creates a competitive element through use of a time limit to the game and a high score stored in the local storage of the browser.
